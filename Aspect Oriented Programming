Aspect is a module which handles repeteative and boiler plate code
Need to add spring boot start aop dependency
@Aspect
intercept some tasks before and after some method invokation
Will have POINT CUT - @Before and @After - Is and expression which tells where ADVICE SHOULD BE APPILED

Types
  Execution 
      access modifier
      Resturen type
      Path to method
        * - matches exactly one item
        .. - matches 0 or more items
  Within
    matches all with in class or package or subpackage
  @within
    Matched class with annotation
    ex: @Before(@within(org.stereotype.Service)) - works for all @Service classes
  @annotation
     Matches any method annotatied with this
    ex @GetMapping
  Args
     @Before("args(String, int)") -> any method with this parameters will trig this aspect, @Before("args(DTO Object name as well)")
     @Before("args(annonation name)) - matches with any method with args matching with the a class having this annotation
 target
  matches any method on a particular instance of class
    @Before("taget(EmplyeeUtil)) - if uses EmployeeUtil class instance then thsi will be called
    can provide interface also
  

-- we can combine two poincuts as well with && and ||
  ex: ("execution( * com.lsjdho.sdjhwo.*())" && @within(RestConttoller))

-- Named POINTCUT
  @Poincut(expression) and then a method without any execution

  Noe @Before(name of the above method)
    {} works


ADVICE : Action taken either before or after or around the method execution

@BEFORE, AFTER -- OKAY
@AROUND ?
possible to run before and after
first statement -  before method
joint.proceed() -> then executes after method


--- How IT OWRKS
  Startup happens 
    looks for @Aspect
    Parse pointcut expression(PointCUT Parser class)
      - store in effecient datstruture or cache
    Look @Component, @Service, @Controller etc
    For each class check s for interception or not based on pointcut expression(uses proxy for it)
    used jdk dynamic proxy or cgli proxy
    if class is child of interface - jdk dynamic is used
    if not -cglib is used - to create subclass of particular class
